# Welcome to Puredot Customer Support Documentation

Puredot's support system leverages AI to auto-generate and update support playbooks from real customer ticket data (via Re:amaze). Our mission: **resolve 90% of repetitive tickets with AI agents while enforcing strict refund and escalation policies.**

## What You'll Find Here
- **AI-Ready Support Playbooks:** Step-by-step guides for common support scenarios, generated from real ticket clusters.
- **Automated Workflows:** Consistent, policy-compliant responses for returns, refunds, shipping, damaged items, and more.
- **Re:amaze Integration:** Ticket data is analyzed, clustered, and transformed into actionable documentation.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Playbooks and policies are updated monthly based on new ticket data and CX team feedback.

## Key Support Topics
- Order updates & shipping
- Inventory & out-of-stock
- Returns, refunds, and cancellations
- Damaged or wrong items
- Address changes
- Escalation and special policies

## How It Works
1. **Ticket Data Export:** Re:amaze ticket data is exported and processed.
2. **AI Analysis:** Tickets are clustered by intent and issue type.
3. **Playbook Generation:** Each cluster gets a dedicated, AI-ready playbook.
4. **Docs Update:** Playbooks are published and indexed for agent and AI use.
