# General Out-of-Stock Substitution

## TL;DR
**Tickets**: 38 (70.4%)  
**Risk**: 7.9% negative

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Confirm Stock Status
- Verify the specific item is out of stock
- Check if it's temporary or permanent unavailability
- Determine expected restock date if available

### 2. Identify Suitable Alternatives
**Primary Approach**: Find similar products in same category
- **Same Brand**: Check for other products from same manufacturer
- **Similar Function**: Offer products with comparable features/benefits
- **Price Point**: Match or improve on original price
- **Quality Level**: Ensure alternative meets or exceeds original quality

### 3. Present Options Clearly
**Template for presenting alternatives**:
- Explain why the original item is unavailable
- Present 2-3 specific alternatives with links
- Highlight benefits of each option
- Mention any price differences (usually same or better)

### 4. Handle Customer Response
**If customer accepts substitution**:
- Confirm their choice immediately
- Update order in system
- Provide new order details and timeline

**If customer declines all options**:
- Offer to hold order until restock
- Provide refund option
- Suggest notification when item becomes available

### 5. Follow Up
- Confirm order changes in system
- Send updated order confirmation
- Provide tracking when available
- Check satisfaction after delivery

## Preventive Guidance

- **Inventory Alerts**: Set up low-stock notifications for high-demand items
- **Alternative Planning**: Maintain backup inventory for frequently out-of-stock items
- **Supplier Relationships**: Build relationships with multiple suppliers for key products
- **Customer Communication**: Proactive notifications for known stock issues
- **Data Analysis**: Track which items frequently go out of stock to improve forecasting
