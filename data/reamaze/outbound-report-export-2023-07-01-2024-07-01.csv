Thank you for your recent order with BoxNCase Help Center. We made an attempt to contact you by phone, but unfortunately, we were unable to reach you. Your order for the Hibiscus flowers is ready to be shipped. However, due to the extremely hot weather conditions in your region, we recommend shipping it overnight to ensure the flowers arrive in the best possible condition.

To proceed with overnight shipping, there will be an additional charge of $29.97. Please let us know how you would like to proceed with your order so we can ensure it reaches you promptly and in perfect condition.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,  
Katy
